# Reproducing the Code
---
This section introduces how to replicate the code and how to get the required data. The code used to produce these maps can be found in a separate jupyter notebook called Code_Final_Assessment.ipynb. While it generally follows the structure outlined in the methodology, under each figure in the report, the code corresponding to its creation will be cited for ease of reproducibility and transparency.

The notebook of the completed report will be accessible in my Github Repo as "Report_Final_Assessment". Furthermore, the data needed to reproduce these maps will also be uploaded to a google drive folder. It will also be made available in a folder called "data" uploaded to this repository.
